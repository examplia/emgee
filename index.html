      <h2>TC2 Workshop Map Submission Criteria</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The current TC2 map pool contains <strong>many</strong> TF2 maps, and that is something we <strong>are looking to change</strong>.</li>
        <li>We want future maps to be <strong>high quality, completely original</strong> and consistent with other maps.
          <ul>
            <li>The only map that currently meets these standards is <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code>, and even it has some flaws.
              <ul>
                <li>To increase your chances of your map being added, study <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code> very attentively: attention to detail, prop frequency, terrain creation, etc.</li>
                <li>Maps should not look like they are part of <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code>, but rather part of the same world.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High quality</strong> means craftsmanship—when you look closer, you say “a lot of effort was put into this.”</li>
            <li><strong>Completely original</strong> means every aspect was created by the mapper. Instead of copying TF2, ask yourself “what would work here?”</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent</strong> means meeting the same detail level and art-style as other maps.
              <ul>
                <li>Although <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code> is the only satisfactory map now, future maps should match its art-style, not TF2’s.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>More resources on map detailing/layouts are coming, but for now:
          <ul>
            <li>Do not use any TF2 props—use the provided prop pack and get creative.</li>
            <li>Focus on parts for detailing, not props. Make walls pretty!</li>
            <li>Master triangle terrain: study <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code> and see how little props are needed outdoors.</li>
            <li>For similarly themed areas, copy <code>3cp_yellowvalley</code> designs 1:1 for consistency.</li>
            <li>Art-style is 2000–2010: nature reserves, mines, factories—GRN protects, RED exploits.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For any questions regarding your maps, ping <strong>@FWEEEEEE</strong> on the official TC2 Discord!</li>
      </ul>
